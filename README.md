# deicer

Python script to delete all archives from an s3 Glacier Vault and then
the vault itself.

## running

this code uses poetry to manage dependencies. to run the script:

1. set the proper env vars: `cp .env.example .env` and edit .env
2. install the packages needed: `poetry install`
3. start the venv: `poetry shell`
4. run the script: `python3 deicer.py`

You should see some debug information checking the auth configuration
and then get a warning: type `no` to quit or just hit enter to accept
the default `yes`:

```shell

```

The script will run for a potentially **verrrrry** long time depending on how much data you have (up to days), but will sleep 900 seconds in between checking for the status.
